# Papers We Love Portland

This is the repository for the Portland, OR chapter of Papers We Love. As a local chapter we follow the Papers We Love [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md).

### Welcome

What was the last paper you read and loved within the realm of computing? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Or, just come, listen, and discuss!

We're curating this repository for papers presented at PWL PDX. You can contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories, like the _main_ Papers We Love repo, [here](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love).

If you need to reach out to us or have ideas for papers, just ask us via our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pwlpdx) account!
